# KickStart-My-Chart

## Background 
Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Technology

Excel was used to modify and analyze the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some of the market trends.

## Conclusions
1.	What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?

    a.	Campaign with Music category are most likely to become successful. It if followed by theatre. Games and food categories are the most likely to fail. 
    b.	Documentary, classical music, electronic music, hardware, non-fiction, pop, radio &podcast, rock, shorts, table top games, and television subcategories have a 100% track record of success. 
    c.	There are less projects created in December and the probability of success decreases as compared to other times of the year. 

2.	What are some of the limitations of this dataset?

    The dataset does not include any information about the creators of the Kickstarter. The lack of this information will prevent us from painting a full picture regarding why the projects were successful. For example, a famous person will have a higher chance of success and that would be overlooked by the data presented. In addition, the dataset does not mention the number of people who looked at each campaign. This will give us which ones were truly appealing to the public based on the percentage of people who looked at the campaign and contributed. 
    
3.	What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?

    a.	We can graph goal amount with pledged amount to see if the amount of money needed has impact on whether a project secures funding. 
    b.	We can create a pivot to show the number of projects in canceled, failed, like and successful status per country. This might help us determine if the location of the project has impact on the success of the project.
